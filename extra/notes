where can I put all the additinal stuff like notes?


- options for placement of the labels
- testing the function
- in cuminc: I changed the plotting mechanism: see MULTIPLY project
- I need a solution for waiver(), just adding some breaks manually do not woek either
- cumulative icnidence single group: when median is not reached for one or more competing events,
  then NA is printed in the plot
- cumulative incidence curve single group: statt 1 und 2 soll wirklich der Name der competing risk geplotted sein
- cumulative incidence curve two groups: problems with colors when running everyting
