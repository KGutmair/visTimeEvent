where can I put all the additinal stuff like notes?

- all the assertion stuff: I need a solution, if I have for example waiver( as default or false)
- assertion: maybe acception NAs in time and event?
- options for placement of the labels

- testing, whether the median table and probability table are now referenced in the right manner
- and maybe deleting some redundancies or making a better column selection
- checking p-values, whether the log-rank test is used
