# Description

This package provides functions for creating Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence plots. These functions serve as wrappers for ggsurvfit() and cuminc(), allowing for the quick generation of well-formatted visualizations. Users can choose to display the median time-to-event probability, median cumulative incidence, or event probability at a specific timepoint along with corresponding confidence intervals. When comparing two groups, the plot includes the p-value from the appropriate hypothesis test for assessing differences between them.

Following functions are available:

-   Kaplan-Meier curves:

    -   `km_single`: This function plots the Kaplan-Meier curve for a single group.

    -   `km_grouped`: This function plots the Kaplan-Meier curve stratified by two groups. The p-value from the log-rank or Wilcoxon test is included in the plot.

    -   `km_grouped_weighted`: This function plots weighted Kaplan-Meier curves for two groups, using weights such as those from Propensity Score Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) or other methods. The p-value from the stratified log-rank test is also displayed.

-   Cumulative incidence curves:

    -   `comp_risk_single`: This function plots the cumulative incidence curves for competing events.

    -   `comp_risk_grouped`: This function Plots cumulative incidence curves for two groups with competing events, showing only the first event. The p-value for comparing the curves is also displayed.
  

# Examples

```{r setup}
library(visTimeEvent)
library(survival)
library(dplyr)
```


## Kaplan-Meier curves

```{r example}
test_dat <- survival::pbc
test_dat <- test_dat %>%
  mutate(
    status_death = ifelse(status == 2, 1, 0),
    time = time / 365,
    trt = as.factor(ifelse(trt == 1, "treatment", "placebo")),
    trt_num = ifelse(trt == "treatment", 1, 0),
    status = as.factor(status)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(trt))
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r KM-plot, one group, fig.width=7}
plot_km <- km_single(
  data = test_dat,
  time = "time",
  event = "status_death",
  title = "Kaplan-Meier curves for one group",
  unit = "years",
  endpoint = "OS",
  colors = "darkblue",
  show_label = "median"
)
plot_km[[1]]
```

```{r KM-plot, two groups, fig.width=7, fig.height= 5}
plot_km1 <- km_grouped(
  data = test_dat,
  time = "time",
  event = "status_death",
  group = "trt",
  time_survival = 6,
  test = "wilcoxon",
  title = "Kaplan-Meier curves for two groups",
  unit = "years",
  endpoint = "OS",
  colors = c("darkblue", "darkgreen"),
  show_label = "probability"
)

plot_km1[[1]]
```

## Cumulative incidence curves

Plotted are both competing events
```{r cumulative incidence plot, one group, fig.width=7}
plot_cum <- comp_risk_single(
  data = test_dat,
  time = "time",
  event = "status",
  title = "Competing risk of a single group",
  unit = "years",
  colors = c("darkred", "darkblue"),
  show_label = "probability",
  time_survival = 8
)

plot_cum[[1]]
```


Plotted are the competing event labeled with 1
```{r cumulative incidence plot, two groups, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
plot_cum1 <- comp_risk_grouped(
  data = test_dat,
  time = "time",
  event = "status",
  group = "trt",
  title = "Competing risk of two group",
  unit = "years",
  colors = c("darkgreen", "deepskyblue3"),
  show_label = "probability",
  time_survival = 8
)
plot_cum1[[1]]
```
