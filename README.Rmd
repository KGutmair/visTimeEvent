# visTimeEvent

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of visTimeEvent is to quickly generate well-formatted Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence curves, with or without competing risks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of visTimeEvent from [GitHub](https://github.com/KGutmair/visTimeEvent) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("KGutmair/visTimeEvent")
```

# Description

This package provides functions for creating Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence plots. These functions serve as wrappers for ggsurvfit() and cuminc(), allowing for the quick generation of well-formatted visualizations. Users can choose to display the median time-to-event probability, median cumulative incidence, or event probability at a specific timepoint along with corresponding confidence intervals. When comparing two groups, the plot includes the p-value from the appropriate hypothesis test for assessing differences between them.

Following functions are available:

-   Kaplan-Meier curves:

    -   `km_single`: This function plots the Kaplan-Meier curve for a single group.

    -   `km_grouped`: This function plots the Kaplan-Meier curve stratified by two groups. The p-value from the log-rank or Wilcoxon test is included in the plot.

    -   `km_grouped_weighted`: This function plots weighted Kaplan-Meier curves for two groups, using weights such as those from Propensity Score Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) or other methods. The p-value from the stratified log-rank test is also displayed.

-   Cumulative incidence curves:

    -   `comp_risk_single`: This function plots the cumulative incidence curves for competing events.

    -   `comp_risk_grouped`: This function Plots cumulative incidence curves for two groups with competing events, showing only the first event. The p-value for comparing the curves is also displayed.





# Example

```{r example}
library(visTimeEvent)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}

```



```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```
